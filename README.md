# DAO Discussion Forums: Exploratory Toxicity and Bridging Analysis of Radicle Forum Posts

In this project, I collected forum posts from Radicle's governance forum with Boardroom's Governance API and conducted an exploratory toxicity and bridging attribute analysis of Radicle forum posts.

I sought to gain an initial understanding of how *civil* conversations are in the Radicle governance forum, and a starting point for future research in assessing civility in DAO governance forums.

I found that the distributions for toxicity scores were right skewed, while the distributions for bridging scores were most often left-skewed or close to left-skewed.

Tools:

- Plotly
- Pandas
- Google's Perspective API
- Boardroom's Governance API
- Beautiful Soup 4
- Requests

Areas:

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Social Media Analysis
