# Summary

In this article, I conducted an exploratory analysis of link sharing
(i.e., forward links) activity in the Radicle governance forum.

![](https://assets.pubpub.org/lnxa57on/newplot (82)-21740706525452.png){#n385m0ji523}

I found that 2022 had the most forward links with 4,618, and 2020 having
the fewest forward links with 11.

lftherios, yorgos, and cloudhead.

# Introduction

In a series of pubs, I plan to document my explorations analyzing DAO
governance forums to determine any insights that could:

1.  be useful or informative[^1] to the public, DAO operators and
    researchers, and other relevant stakeholders; and

2.  provide guidance for designing and measuring (i.e., analyzing)
    DAOs.[^2]

Here, I conducted an exploratory analysis of link sharing (i.e., forward
links) activity in the Radicle governance forum.

I believe this analysis, and further investigations of this kind, will
benefit the potential users listed in the
[Appendix](https://ledgerback.pubpub.org/pub/ssjh6v6t#appendix "null").

# Data

### Original Dataset

I collected forum posts from [Radworks' Governance
Forum](https://community.radworks.org/ "null")* *from Boardroom's
Governance API with the requests Python library, as of 2024-09-19.

You can find the dataset for forum posts below.

### Transformation 

As the content in the body field (i.e., column) is formatted in HTML, I
used the Beautiful Soup 4 Python library to collect the href and class
attributes in *a *tags.

I retained the id, topicId, and topicIdPostNumber fields from the RFPD
for identification purposes.

### Final Dataset

After manipulating the dataset with the Pandas python library, I arrived
at the final dataset below.

For this post, just need the columns used in the final dataset for
analysis.

\[iframe element\]

The RFPLAD contains 11,738 rows and twelve (12) columns.

You can find the RFPLAD's data dictionary below.

## Analysis

Through my exploratory analysis, I sought to answer the following
questions:

1.  What is the most popular link mentioned in the forum?;

2.  How many links are mentioned on a yearly basis?;

3.  What are the five (5) most popular external domains by count?;

4.  What is the most popular domain by linkCount?;

5.  What is the average number of links per post?;

6.  What are the top five (5) posts with the most links?;

7.  What is the relationship between the number of links mentioned in a
    post and engagement metrics?;

8.  What is the total number of links mentioned in the forum?;

9.  Who are the top five (5) most mentioned users?;

10. Who are the top five (5) users by linkCount?;

11. Which users are sharing the most links?; and

12. What is the count of links per post?

# Findings & Discussion 

## What is the average number of links per post?

The average number of forward links per post is 4.20 links.

## What is the total number of forward links?

The total number of forward links is 11, 703.[^3]

## What is the most popular link mentioned in the forum? (should this be a tag?)

The most popular link mentioned in the forum was
https://community.radworks.org/u/abbey.

## How many links are mentioned on a yearly basis?

![](https://assets.pubpub.org/lnxa57on/newplot (82)-21740706525452.png){#nue052nro97}

Trend-wise, forward links have been on a downturn since 2022.

2022 having the most forward links with 4,618, and 2020 having the
fewest forward links with 11.

The forward link count has not fell under the 2021 count of 1,773.

## Who are the five (5) most mentioned users?

  userName    URL                                          mentionCount
  ----------- -------------------------------------------- --------------
  abbey       https://community.radworks.org/u/abbey       211
  bordumb     https://community.radworks.org/u/bordumb     199
  lftherios   https://community.radworks.org/u/lftherios   162
  yorgos      https://community.radworks.org/u/yorgos      131
  cloudhead   https://community.radworks.org/u/cloudhead   126

## What is the most popular domain by linkCount?[^4]

  **fqdn**                 **linkCount**
  ------------------------ ---------------
  community.radworks.org   3475
  github.com               1086
  twitter.com              247
  www.linkedin.com         148
  snapshot.org             143
  www.notion.so            116
  app.radicle.xyz          82
  docs.radicle.xyz         76
  discord.gg               68

## What are the top five (5) posts with the most links?

  **topicIdPostNumber**   **linkCount**
  ----------------------- ---------------
  16/31/3280/1            94
  16/31/2582/1            85
  16/46/3419/1            81
  16/46/2548/1            78
  16/31/3420/1            77

Unexpectedly, the first post for many topics was the post with the most
links. So, it is possible to say that the original poster (OP) is most
likely to engage in high-frequency link sharing behavior.

## Is there a correlation between the number of links mentioned in a post and engagement metrics?

+-----------------------+---------------+
| **engagementMetric**\ | **linkCount** |
+=======================+===============+
| reads                 | -0.129947     |
+-----------------------+---------------+
| readersCount          | -0.129969     |
+-----------------------+---------------+
| likeCount             | 0.208749      |
+-----------------------+---------------+
| quoteCount            | -0.068352     |
+-----------------------+---------------+
| replyCount            | 0.023708      |
+-----------------------+---------------+
| body_links_count      | 1.000000      |
+-----------------------+---------------+

The Pearson correlation coefficients between linkCount and engagement
metrics is mentioned in the table above.

There was little to no relationship between linkCount and engagement
metrics.

## Which users are sharing the most links?

### All Users

![](https://assets.pubpub.org/4e471wp6/newplot (86)-11740936935561.png){#nd07l4zv198}

### Top twenty (20) Users

![](https://assets.pubpub.org/xj2t0g54/newplot (87)-31740936928884.png){#ndlsh9z29v5}

Most users shared less than five (5) links.

From the top twenty users, we see a sharp increase in the count of links
shared.

Interestingly enough, the top five most mentioned users (abbey,
bordrumb, lftherios, yorgos, cloudhead) are also among the top twenty
(20) users sharing links.

## What is the count of links per post? 

![](https://assets.pubpub.org/2hjxwpqu/newplot (84)-31740936126003.png){#nlg36cau293}

The majority of posts had zero forward links. From those posts with a
forward link, the majority had one to five links, with linkCount tailing
off around forty (40) links.

        DAO members;

    2.  Can use this analysis to develop promotional materials for the
        forum,

    3.  Can use this analysis to see how users are using forward links
        in the forum;

        forums and how DAOs are using discussion forums.

3.  DAO Operators

    1.  Can use this analysis to determine how DAO members are
        contributing to the DAO via their forum activity.

4.  DAO Tooling Developers

    1.  Can use this analysis to see if and how often DAO members are
        mentioning their tools like Snapshot in their forum.

5.  The public

    1.  Can use this type of analysis for greater insights into the

[^1]: Or generally interesting.

[^2]: More specifically, discussion forums for DAOs.

[^3]: This statistic only includes *a* tags that had an href attribute.

[^4]: This table only includes a tags that had an href attribute that
    had a properly formatted URL. Interesting enough, blank or N/A had
    the highest count with 3,975. Additionally, I did not include
    internal links unless they included mentions (anchors were
    excluded).
